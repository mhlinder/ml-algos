Simple Machine Learning Algorithms
=================================
These are some basic machine learning algorithms, applied to the Kaggle toy competition [Digit Recognizer](http://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer). These algos are not intended to be sophisticated, nor are they necessarily appropriate for this problem; I've focused here on the implementation of algorithms, rather than solving a problem. To that end, these are general machine learning approaches, supervised and unsupervised, that can be applied to a variety of problems
### Benchmark: simple averaging
### Naive Bayes
### PCA and Naive Bayes
